# Contact Tracing

Contact tracing is about you out and about, and doing two things: 1) letting people around you know about your health condition and 2) knowing the health condition of them. If you are feeling sick, others should know and maybe act accordingly if they get sick a few days later.  Likewise, if you are around people who are sick, you might take appropriate actions if you feel sick.

So how do we do (1) and (2)? Walk into a grocery store and yell out "I'm not feeling well...if you get sick in a couple of days, it might be because of me!" No.  But how about using some tech to quietly inform those around us about our condition?

Mobile phones are thought to be ideal for this. They can broadcast a short Bluetooth message to those around you for easy assessment by all later on. Well, by Summer 2020, it was clear phone-based contact tracers weren't going to work. No one trusts the multitude of Apps, and approaches to contract tracing are confusing. How do you register? How? Why are the Apps different, and who will have access to my information? Also, mobile phone privacy is forever suspect. The latest round is the clipboard spying in stories such as [this one](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4017082/tiktok-spying-clipboard-researchers-warn-iphone-users) and [this one](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/07/04/apple-ios-14-catches-microsofts-linkedin-spying-on-clipboard-tiktok-apps-privacy-iphone-ipad-macbook/#ecac5085896e). Phones and Apps are for fun and communication, but no one is going to trust them with health information.

# NPCP: The "no phone" Contact Tracer

Also by summer 2020, the virus was really getting to me. The news was bad and getting worse.  Would we ever emerge from this?I wanted do do something--anything---to help us through the Covid-19 outbreak. Contact tracing can help, so I thought I'd work on th in containing the Covid-19 outbreak.
