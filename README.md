# Contact Tracing

Contact tracing is about you going out and about, and doing two things: (1) letting people around you know about your health condition and (2) knowing the health condition of those same people. If you are feeling sick, others should know and maybe act accordingly if they get sick a few days later.  Likewise, if you are around people who are sick, you might take appropriate actions if you feel sick.

So how do we do (1) and (2)?  Do we walk into a grocery store and yell out "I'm not feeling well...if you get sick in a couple of days, it might be because of me!" No.  But how about using some tech. to quietly inform those around us about our condition?

Mobile phones are perhaps ideal for this. "Everyone already has one," and they can broadcast short Bluetooth messages about your health to those nearby for easy tracking by all later on. Well, by Summer 2020, it was clear phone-based contact tracers weren't going to work. No one trusts the Apps, and approaches to contract tracing are confusing. Am I really doing anything? How do I register? How? Why are the Apps different, and who will have access to my information? 

Also, although a phone itself may be secure as a device, Apps, privacy, and what they do with your data is kind of a joke.  The latest round is the clipboard spying in stories such as [this one](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4017082/tiktok-spying-clipboard-researchers-warn-iphone-users) and [this one](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/07/04/apple-ios-14-catches-microsofts-linkedin-spying-on-clipboard-tiktok-apps-privacy-iphone-ipad-macbook/#ecac5085896e) didn't help. Phones and Apps are for fun and communication, but no one is going to trust them with health information. (If you want full privacy, leave your phone off and at home. The "bag trick" [here](https://youtu.be/s3poKUuvtyM?t=55) would actuall works, BTW.)

Also by summer 2020, the virus was really getting to me. The news was bad and getting worse.  Would we ever emerge from this?  I wanted do do something--anything---to help us through the Covid-19 outbreak. Contact tracing can help, so I thought I'd work on something to help contain the Covid-19 outbreak.
